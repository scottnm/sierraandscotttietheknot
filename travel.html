            </h2>
            <p class="mb-0">Seattle has great options for transportation, including public transit and rideshare. Parking is limited in Seattle, especially in the areas you're most likely to want to visit, so please make sure you are prepared for city driving, parallel parking, and paid parking garages if you plan to rent a car!</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The Light Rail is a subway-like system that runs from south of the airport all the way up to the University of Washington. It hits most of the major areas you'll want to go. You can buy single trip tickets, day passes, or Orca Cards (see below) from the kiosks at any Light Rail station. If you are staying near one of the Light Rail stops, you can catch the Light Rail from the airport. It's much cheaper than taking a rideshare!</li>
              <li>The King County Metro system is pretty reliable, so buses are a great way to get around. You'll need exact change or an Orca Card to ride the bus. The OneBusAway app is a great way to fine bus stops and arrival times. Google Maps also does a great job.</li>
              <li>Orca Cards are metro passes that work for the buses, trains, and Light Rail. All you have to do is tap your card to the machine and it will automatically deduct the fare. If you get an Orca Card and use it on the light rail, make sure you tap the card before you get on the train <em>and</em> when you get off. On the bus, you only need to tap it once when you get on.</li>
              <li>Rideshare:
                  <ul>
                    <li>For more localized travel, you'll find Lime Bikes and Jump Bikes scattered around the sidewalks. You'll need accounts and the respective apps.</li>
                    <li>Seattle is overflowing with Uber and Lyft drivers, so if all else fails, it always easy to grab one.</li>
                  </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Seattle is a very walkable city! You can walk almost anywhere you want to go. Seattle summers are nice, so consider walking instead of paying for a ride if you aren't going far.</li>

However, Seattle public transportation is fantastic, so between ride share and public transportation, getting to the venue should be doable from almost anywhere. Below are a few neighborhoods of Seattle that are great to stay in or visit.</p>

              Gerogetown is one of the oldest neighborhoods in Seattle and a home to many art studios and galleries. The venue is in Georgetown, and the Georgetown Inn is within walking distance of the venue and has good reviews. Otherwise, there aren't a lot of options either for hotels or Airbnb in the area.

            <p class="mb-0">While the heart of Downtown Seattle is the Business district and not the most exciting visit, the northern end of Downtown and neighboring Belltown have a lot of nice hotels and are home to Pike Place Market, The Spheres (Amazon's botanical garden), and many bars and restaurants. You can walk a few blocks to the pier for waterfront restaurants and activities, or take a ferry to Bainbridge Island. There are several Light Rail stations in Downtown Seattle that will take you to North to Capitol Hill or the Univeristy of Washington and South to Pioneer Square, International District, SoDo, and farther, including the airport.

            <p class="mb-0">Capitol Hill is the 6th Street of Seattle. It's full of bars, clubs, restaurants, indie shops, and Bruce Lee's grave. It's always an adventure in Capitol Hill. Everything is in walking distance, and the Capitol Hill Light Rail stop provides easy transportation to other areas of town. However, neighboring South Lake Union may provide more hotel options. SLU is Amazon-central. It's a beautiful neighborhood bordering Lake Union and just next door to the Space Needle and Amazon headquarters. You'll find lots of trendy restaurants and food trucks around here, all with a great view of the water.

It is currently unknown when the bridge will reopen, so getting to and from West Seattle is currently very difficult.
